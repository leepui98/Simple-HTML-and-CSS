		The basic elements of <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_fried_rice#:~:text=Leftover%20cooked%20rice%20among%20the,in%20East%20and%20Southeast%20Asia." >Chinese fried rice </a> are cooked rice preferably leftovers from yesterday, meat and vegetables possibly also leftovers, mixed with egg, soy sauce and garlic for flavour and seasoning, also cooking oil for greasing; either using lard, vegetable oil or sesame oil. The oil and soy sauce grease and coat the rice grains, thus preventing them from burning and sticking to the cooking vessel. Sometimes chopped scallion, ginger, chili pepper and mushroom, also diced processed pork are added into the mixture. All ingredients are stir-fried on a strong fire using a Chinese wok cooking vessel, and the rice is turned, stirred and agitated using a spatula to evenly cook the rice and distribute the seasoning.

        The main ingredients of nasi goreng include pre-cooked rice, sweet soy sauce, powdered terasi (shrimp paste), salt, garlic, shallot, chilli pepper, spring onions, nutmeg, turmeric, vegetable oil, onions, palm sugar, ginger garlic paste, and slices of cucumber and tomato for garnishing. Some recipes may add black pepper, fish sauce, or powdered broth as a seasoning and taste enhancer. Eggs might be mixed into fried rice or fried separately, either as telur ceplok/telur mata sapi (sunny side up eggs), or telur dadar (omelette), and also telur rebus (boiled eggs). Originally optional, the addition of fried egg is often named as nasi goreng spesial (pakai telur) or special fried rice topped with fried egg.

Crack the eggs into the well, then use a rubber spatula to start gently moving the eggs around to create big curds.Break in the tofu, then fold the rice back through the egg until itï¿½s all looking good. Taste and season to perfection.Lightly oil the inside of a bowl, add the stir-fried rice, gently compacting it with the spatula, then proudly turn out on to a plate.
